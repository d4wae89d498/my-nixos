Just few nix basics for daily usage : 

OS:
- paris tz
- fzf, vim. screen, git, htop, htop ... and few other basics

VIM:
- no vim LSP (it would be defined in an other env -- maybe using this time a neovim that would source current vim conf)
- left tree in vim + CTRL+B vscode alike shortcut
- basic vim airline
- right click copy OK in visual mode
- CURSOR change fixup for wsl
- vim most useful default (colorcolumn, showcmd, 4 spaces etc.)

SCREEN:
- screen bottom bar with cpu/ram/time/pid
- screen now escape with CTRL+B (maybe it would change) BUT so CTRL+A/E works as expected
